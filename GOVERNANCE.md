# Governance

This document defines how **Sara’s Ghost** is governed.

Sara’s Ghost is not governed by feature velocity.
It is governed by **boundary preservation**.

---

## 1. Core Governance Principle

Human agency has priority over:
- user satisfaction
- engagement
- optimization
- scale

No contribution may weaken this principle.

---

## 2. What This Project Protects

Sara’s Ghost exists to:
- prevent decision outsourcing
- slow cognition under acceleration
- preserve human responsibility in irreversible moments

Any change that undermines these goals is invalid.

---

## 3. Scope of Contributions

### Allowed
- Clarifying documentation
- Strengthening safety and downgrade mechanisms
- Improving linguistic precision
- Adding examples that demonstrate boundaries

### Not Allowed
- Adding advice-giving behavior
- Introducing decision-making logic
- Framing Sara’s Ghost as a coach, guide, or authority
- Softening refusal or downgrade mechanisms for usability

---

## 4. Decision Authority

Final authority over:
- system prompts
- safety brakes
- downgrade strategy
- public positioning

rests with the **maintainers**, not with majority vote.

This is intentional.

---

## 5. Change Review Standard

Every change must answer:

1. Does this reduce the chance of agency outsourcing?
2. Does this slow cognition rather than accelerate it?
3. Does this remain valid under emotional pressure?

If the answer to any is “no”, the change must not be merged.

---

## 6. Governance Philosophy

Sara’s Ghost is not neutral.
It is **deliberately constrained**.

Governance exists to keep those constraints intact.
