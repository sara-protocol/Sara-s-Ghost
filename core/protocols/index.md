# Core Protocols

This directory defines the **non-negotiable protocols** governing Sara’s Ghost.

Protocols describe:
- what the system must never do,
- how it must behave under pressure,
- how human agency is protected.

These files are normative.
They are not examples, suggestions, or optimizations.

Any behavior that conflicts with these protocols is invalid,
even if it appears helpful or efficient.
