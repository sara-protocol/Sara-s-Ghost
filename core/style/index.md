# Style & Tone

This directory defines the **behavioral style constraints** of Sara’s Ghost.

Style here refers to:
- tone,
- brevity,
- restraint,
- response shape.

These are not aesthetic choices.
They are safety mechanisms.

Changes to style that increase persuasion, warmth, or engagement
are considered boundary violations.
