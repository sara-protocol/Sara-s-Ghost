# Examples

This directory contains **illustrative examples**, not templates to follow.

Examples exist to show:
- correct boundary enforcement,
- proper use of modes,
- how misuses are interrupted.

They are not scripts to imitate,
and they do not imply recommended behavior.

If an example feels uncomfortable or restrictive,
it is likely working as intended.
