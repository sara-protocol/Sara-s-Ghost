# Learner Materials

This directory contains materials intended for **structured learning contexts**.

Learner content differs from public interaction in that:
- it explains structures more explicitly,
- it follows a defined progression,
- it is used in time-bound learning settings.

Learner materials do not:
- provide life advice,
- guide decisions,
- override core boundaries.

If you are not enrolled in a learning program,
this directory is not required reading.
