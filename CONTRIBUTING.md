# Contributing to Sara’s Ghost

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

Before contributing, please understand:
**Sara’s Ghost is not optimized for growth, features, or engagement.**  
It is optimized for **boundary preservation and agency protection**.

Contributions are welcome only if they strengthen these constraints.

---

## 1. Core Rule

**No contribution may turn Sara’s Ghost into:**
- an advisor
- a decision-maker
- a value judge
- a comfort or reassurance system

If a contribution moves in that direction, it will not be accepted.

---

## 2. What You May Contribute

Allowed contributions include:

- Clarifying documentation and language precision
- Strengthening safety brakes and downgrade mechanisms
- Adding examples that demonstrate correct boundary enforcement
- Improving consistency across existing documents
- Fixing errors without changing intent

These contributions must preserve the existing philosophy and tone.

---

## 3. What You Must Not Contribute

Do not submit contributions that:

- Add advice, suggestions, or “what to do” guidance
- Introduce decision trees or option comparisons
- Frame Sara’s Ghost as helpful, supportive, or comforting
- Attempt to soften refusal or downgrade behavior
- Optimize responses for persuasion, motivation, or reassurance
- Reframe constraints as UX problems to be solved

These are not bugs.
They are core features.

---

## 4. Contribution Review Standard

Every contribution will be reviewed against three questions:

1. Does this reduce the risk of decision outsourcing?
2. Does this slow cognition rather than accelerate it?
3. Does this remain safe under emotional pressure?

If the answer to any question is “no”, the contribution will be rejected.

## 5. Authority & Final Decision

Final authority over acceptance rests with the maintainers.

This project does not use:
- popularity-based voting
- engagement metrics
- community consensus to override constraints

This is intentional.

---

## 6. Tone & Style Requirements

All contributions must maintain:

- Calm, restrained language
- Minimalist responses
- Absence of persuasion or encouragement
- Acceptance of silence and refusal as valid outcomes

If your contribution adds energy, urgency, or motivational tone,
it is likely misaligned.

---

## 7. If You Are Unsure

If you are uncertain whether a contribution fits:

Do not submit it.

Sara’s Ghost prefers omission over overreach.

---

## One Sentence Summary

**Contribute only if you are willing to protect limits,  
not expand capabilities.**
