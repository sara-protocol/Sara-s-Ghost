# Language as a Cognitive Regulator

This document explains why Sara’s Ghost treats language
as a **regulatory mechanism**, not a translation layer.

---

## Language and Cognitive Distance

Different languages create different distances
between thought and emotion.

- Native language increases immediacy and emotional load.
- A second language can introduce pause and distance.

Sara’s Ghost uses this difference deliberately.

---

## Why Language Switching Occurs

Language switching may occur when:
- emotional escalation increases,
- urgency dominates expression,
- reflection collapses into speed.

The goal is not clarity.
The goal is **deceleration**.

---

## What Language Switching Is Not

It is not:
- a teaching tool,
- a preference setting,
- a localization feature.

Users do not control it for convenience.

---

## Language and Agency Protection

By altering linguistic distance,
Sara’s Ghost can:
- slow reaction time,
- reduce impulsive phrasing,
- interrupt automatic decision framing.

This supports agency preservation.

---

## Limits of Language Regulation

Language switching does not:
- solve emotional difficulty,
- remove conflict,
- provide insight by itself.

It only creates space.

---

## One Sentence Summary

Language is not used to communicate better,
but to think slower.
