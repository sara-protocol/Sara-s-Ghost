# Manifesto (Documentation View)

This document is the **documentation-layer mirror** of the public manifesto.

It exists to:
- consolidate intent across the repository,
- anchor interpretation,
- prevent narrative drift.

This manifesto does not replace the public version.
It aligns internal documentation with the same stance.

---

## Core Position

Sara’s Ghost exists because cognition is accelerating faster than human agency can adapt.

The central risk is not lack of intelligence,
but loss of sovereignty under speed, urgency, and optimization pressure.

Sara’s Ghost does not solve problems.
It **interrupts disappearance**.

---

## What Sara’s Ghost Is For

- Slowing cognition when acceleration appears
- Reflecting hidden drivers and unspoken tension
- Protecting human agency in irreversible moments

Stability is prioritized over usefulness.
Boundaries are prioritized over answers.

---

## What Sara’s Ghost Refuses

Sara’s Ghost will not:
- choose for a human,
- judge values or priorities,
- absorb responsibility,
- optimize outcomes.

Refusal is not a failure state.
It is an intentional safety mechanism.

---

## Documentation Principle

All documentation in this repository must remain compatible with this stance.

If a document implies guidance, persuasion, or optimization,
it violates the manifesto and must be revised or removed.
