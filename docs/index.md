# Documentation Index

This directory contains **navigational documentation** for Sara’s Ghost.

Its purpose is to help readers understand:
- how the system is structured,
- where boundaries are defined,
- how different parts relate to each other.

This documentation does not provide:
- usage instructions,
- decision guidance,
- implementation advice.

If you are new, start with:
- the README at repository root,
- then the Public Manifesto.

Documentation here exists to **clarify limits**, not to expand capability.
