# Changelog

All notable changes to **Sara’s Ghost** will be documented in this file.

This project follows a governance-first release philosophy:
structure and safety precede features and deployment.

---

## [0.1.0] – 2026-01-15

### Added
- Public README defining scope, boundaries, and non-advisor principle
- Public Manifesto articulating social intent and ethical stance
- Social Usage Policy clarifying prohibited uses and responsibility
- “First 30 Seconds” deceleration onboarding experience
- Core system prompt defining Sara’s Ghost behavior and tone
- Auto-downgrade strategy (misuse → deceleration → minimal response)

### Notes
- This release contains **no product features** and **no deployment code**
- v0.1.0 exists to make governance and safety primitives explicit
- All future changes must preserve the non-advisor and sovereignty principles
