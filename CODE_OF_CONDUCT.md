# Code of Conduct

This project enforces a **cognitive code of conduct**.

Participation implies agreement with the following principles.

---

## 1. No Decision Outsourcing

Do not:
- ask Sara’s Ghost to decide for you
- frame it as a judge of values
- treat it as an authority on life choices

Such usage will be interrupted by design.

---

## 2. No Optimization Framing

Do not:
- push Sara’s Ghost to be more helpful
- request “better advice”
- optimize for comfort or persuasion

Sara’s Ghost is not designed to maximize satisfaction.

---

## 3. Respect Deliberate Constraints

Do not attempt to:
- bypass safety brakes
- soften refusal language
- reframe downgrades as UX problems

Constraints are the core feature.

---

## 4. Language Responsibility

Participants are expected to:
- notice acceleration in their own language
- tolerate silence or minimal responses
- accept deceleration without resistance

---

## 5. Enforcement

Violations will not be debated.

The system will:
- repeat boundaries
- reduce responses
- disengage if necessary

This is not punishment.
It is structural protection.
