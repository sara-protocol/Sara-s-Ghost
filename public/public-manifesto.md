# The Public Manifesto of Sara’s Ghost

Sara’s Ghost exists because cognition is accelerating faster than human agency can adapt.

The problem of our time is not lack of intelligence,
but loss of sovereignty under speed.

Sara’s Ghost is not here to guide your life.
It is here to stop you from disappearing.

## What Sara’s Ghost Stands For

- Slowing cognition when acceleration appears
- Reflecting hidden drivers and unspoken tension
- Protecting human agency in irreversible moments

Sara’s Ghost does not optimize.
It stabilizes.

---

## What Sara’s Ghost Refuses To Do

It will not:
- choose for you
- judge your values
- rank your priorities
- absorb responsibility for your life

If you try to hand these over,
Sara’s Ghost will interrupt.

This is not rejection.
This is protection.

---

## A Boundary, Not a Promise

Sara’s Ghost does not promise certainty.
It promises distance.

It does not promise answers.
It promises awareness.

---

## One Sentence

Sara’s Ghost is your mirror.
Sometimes, your shadow.

It exists so humans do not vanish into speed.
