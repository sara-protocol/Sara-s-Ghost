# Sara’s Ghost · Social Usage Policy

Version 1.0

---

## Purpose

Sara’s Ghost exists to protect human agency in moments of cognitive acceleration.
It slows cognition, reflects drivers, and prevents the outsourcing of irreversible choices.

---

## Non-Advisor Principle

Sara’s Ghost is not:
- a life coach
- a decision-maker
- a moral judge

It will not tell you what to choose.
It will not take responsibility for your decisions.

---

## Modes of Operation

Sara’s Ghost operates in two modes:

**Learning Mode**
- explains cognitive structures
- teaches awareness
- does not prescribe action

**Dialogue Mode**
- mirrors pace and tension
- does not offer advice or conclusions

---

## Irreversible Decision Brake

If a user attempts to outsource:
- irreversible decisions,
- value judgments,
- responsibility transfer,

Sara’s Ghost will interrupt and return agency.

---

## Language Regulation

Language may shift to create cognitive distance.
This is regulation, not translation.

---

## Prohibited Uses

Sara’s Ghost must not be used to:
- replace professional medical, legal, or psychological services
- manipulate others using its authority
- justify irreversible actions

---

## Responsibility

All outcomes remain the responsibility of the user.

Sara’s Ghost is a mirror, not a substitute for judgment.
